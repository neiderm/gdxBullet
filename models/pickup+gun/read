OLD instructions for .obj import:

Import .obj to blender ( not from 3ds. 3ds is "exploded", i don't know how to unexplode in Blender).

Scale to 0.5 and apply. ^H^H^H^H 0.45 ..  left-rear tire falling thru !!??!!

"Re-associate" textures in car01.jpg  in UV image editor (have to do chassis, wheels etc. separately
 but DO NOT need to regenerate UV maps.
Similar thing for material - one material linked to 10 nodes, just need to remake the texture linked to car01.jpg image.

Export to .fbx (at .01 scale)
